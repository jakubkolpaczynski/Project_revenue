# Revenue Project
The work was carried out on the basis of data from a company selling computer games over a 10-month period. The project is intended to show changes in recurring revenue in individual months and the factors influencing these changes (Paid Users, Churned Users, ARPPU). Pointers to the project were created via SQL queries. The entire project is illustrated by a dashboard created in Tableau.
